## About
The **Corex Team** is a volunteer-driven, international group of developers, testers, and contributors behind **Corex Linux**. Our mission is to maintain and develop a lightweight, best Linux Operating system optimized for older hardware while providing a familiar, Windows-like desktop experience.

Currently, the team consists of only one active contributor, but we are **actively looking for collaborators** to join and help with:

- Software development and kernel improvements  
- Testing and bug reporting  
- Writing documentation and tutorials  
- Community support and engagement  

## How to Join
We welcome contributors of all skill levels. If you want to help, you can:

- Submit pull requests or report issues on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Corex-Project/Corex-Linux)  
- Participate in discussions on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/The-Corex-Project/Corex-Linux/discussions)  
- Share ideas, feedback, and suggestions for new features  

## Community Goals
- Build a small but active open-source community around Corex Linux  
- Keep older hardware usable with a modern, stable OS  
- Encourage collaborative development and learning  

*Thank you for supporting the Corex Team! Every contribution counts.*
